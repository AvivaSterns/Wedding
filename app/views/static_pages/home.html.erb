    <h3>Almost the big day!&nbsp;&nbsp;Parking can be difficult in Hermosa Beach, but for our evening of wedding fun at The Chelsea, we have two excellent options:<br><br>
There is a multi-level lot right across the street from The Chelsea on 13th Street & Hermosa Avenue (behind Starbucks) – Pre-Pay with a Credit Card at the machine in the lot - $1.25 per hour.<br><br>
NOTE: At 5:30pm on a Sunday the “Lot Full” barriers may be out if the beach has been busy, BUT if you drive right around them and enter the lot, there are TONS of spaces on the upper floors.<br><br>
We have also arranged FREE parking at St. Cross Episcopal Church, 1818 Monterey Boulevard, Hermosa Beach, CA 90254 – for each car that uses this lot we will be making a donation to the church, so please let us know if you plan to use it so we can be sure to make good with the church deal.  This lot is a short (7 or 8 minute) walk from The Chelsea. Please use the “Outer Lot” at the North side of the church.</h3>
